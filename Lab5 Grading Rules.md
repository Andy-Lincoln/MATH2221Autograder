# Programming Assignment Grading Rules

| Grade | Criteria | Points |
|-------|----------|--------|
| F | Program fails to execute or contains infinite loops | < 5 points |
| D | Contains logical errors: | 5 points |
|   | - Incorrect handling of p > 100 |  |
|   | - ~10% of programs fail to properly adjust chutes/ladders after overshoots |  |
| C | Implementation errors: | 8 points |
|   | - Wrong starting position (starts from 0 instead of 1) |  |
| A | Complete Implementation: | 10 points |
|   | - Successfully passes all test cases |  |
|   | - Correct game logic implementation |  |

## Detailed Breakdown

### Critical Failures (0-4 points)
- Program crashes on execution
- Presence of infinite loops
- Code does not compile

### Logic Implementation (5-7 points)
- Incorrect boundary handling when p > 100
- Failures in chutes/ladders adjustment after overshoots
- Basic game flow implementation present but with significant errors

### Minor Implementation Issues (8-9 points)
- Starting point initialization error
- Minor logical flaws that don't severely impact gameplay
- Most test cases pass but with some inconsistencies

### Perfect Implementation (10 points)
- All test cases pass successfully
- Proper handling of edge cases
- Correct implementation of game rules
- Clean and efficient code
